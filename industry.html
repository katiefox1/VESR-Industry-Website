    <h2>About the Healthcare Industry</h2>
    <p>
      The healthcare industry includes hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and
      sales organizations that bring life-saving products to providers and patients. It combines science, technology,
      and business to improve health outcomes around the world.

    <h2>My Role at Johnson & Johnson</h2>
    <p>
      I work in <strong>business sales</strong> for Johnson & Johnson, where I help hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers
      access the medical products and technologies they need. My role bridges innovation and client relationships—
      ensuring customers understand product benefits, compliance, and safety.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethical Issue</h2>
    <p>
      A key ethical challenge in healthcare sales is ensuring transparency and honesty when presenting products.
      Overstating product benefits or downplaying risks can mislead providers and harm patient trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data breaches:</strong> Sales data and client health records could be exposed through insecure devices or
        phishing attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ransomware attacks:</strong> Hospitals and healthcare organizations are frequent ransomware targets, which can
        halt operations and compromise sensitive data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all devices and sales systems.</li>
      <li>Encrypt all communications and store data securely in approved company systems.</li>
      <li>Stay alert for phishing emails and verify any unexpected requests for information.</li>
      <li>Regularly update software and follow Johnson & Johnson’s global cybersecurity policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      The healthcare industry depends on both trust and technology. By combining strong cybersecurity practices with
      ethical business behavior, companies like Johnson & Johnson protect patients, partners, and their reputation.
